    Building a full React application
  </strong>
  <p>
    The React and JavaScript ecosystem is full of tools and libraries to help
    you build your applications. In this (huge) workshop weâ€™ll build an
    application from scratch using widely supported and proven tools and
    techniques. Weâ€™ll cover everything about building frontend React
    applications, from the absolute basics to the tricky parts you'll run into
    building real world React apps and how to create great abstractions.
